# What Is Rune?

## Short answer

Rune is a toolkit for building animated ASCII visuals in React apps.

ASCII means text characters like `#`, `.`, `@`, and `*`.
Rune treats those characters like visual building blocks, similar to pixels.

## Why Rune exists

Most visual animation libraries are focused on SVG, Canvas graphics, or video.
Rune is for people who want a text-art style that still feels modern and reusable.

The goal is:

- easy to drop into a React app
- lightweight by default
- theme-aware (light/dark mode)
- composable like UI components

---

I want to build a Native rune is an open-source React component library and CLI for creating mesmerizing ASCII art animations for your site... i want it to treats ASCII characters as visual primitives, letting you drop in mesmerizing, theme-aware text animations the same way you’d use an icon pack or UI component library.

so it would have

- 🌗 Light & dark mode support
- ⚛️ Composable React components
- ✨ Ready-made ASCII animations
- 🛠 CLI generator for scaffolding new runes
- 📦 Fully open source

I put some images above of potential usage, and the 2nd image is how the ASCII animaiton videos should work... how would i do something like this? I want this to be fast and lightweight and native, and a react componenet. i have never done this before so walk me thru this step by step. No code implemtation just planning and research on the web on how i could do this, and interviwewing me… users should I really in the end goal to be able to make their own animations too by uploading a video, and so on.
